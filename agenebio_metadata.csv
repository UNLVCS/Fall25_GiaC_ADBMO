Abstract:
Background:
No effective therapies exist to halt or reverse Alzheimer’s disease (AD). With a predicted prevalence of AD cases rising to >100 million worldwide by 2050, the need for such therapies is urgent. The prevalence of patients with AD dementia, who represent the greatest human and economic burden, could be dramatically reduced by preventing or delaying progression in early phases of the disease, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD (prodromal AD). T"

• The Phase 2B trial showed 40% less clinical decline and significantly reduced atrophy of the
entorhinal cortex, a key marker of disease progression, compared to placebo in ApoE-4 non-

• Patients were given a once-daily dose of AGB-101, a proprietary low-dose extended-release
formulation of levetiracetam or placebo in a randomized controlled trial.

AGB101 is a proprietary formulation of low-dose levetiracetam, given to patients at approximately one-fifteenth of the dose most commonly prescribed for epilepsy. This therapeutic has been commercialized for more than a decade and offers a well-characterized safety profile at fifteen times the expected dose for AGB101. AgeneBio expects to initiate the AGB101 Phase 3 clinical program in the second half of 2015.

The study showed that sustained plasma levels of levetiracetam consistent with AGB101 Phase 2 efficacy were observed over a 14-hour period. Further, the PK profile of AGB101 was consistent with an extended-release formulation suitable for once-daily dosing. Additionally, the study showed that there were no food effects on C max or AUC. The study authors concluded that the AGB101 low-dose, extended-release formulation of AGB101 is suitable for use in the upcoming HOPE4MCI Phase 3"
