"Initiation of a Phase 2 Multicenter Study of 18F-APN-1607, a Novel Diagnostic PET Imaging Tracer for the Characterization of Tau Burden in Alzheimer’s Disease | APRINOIA Therapeutics",,Aprinoia,"APRINOIA Therapeutics, Inc. announced today that it has initiated a Phase 2 multicenter, multinational study of    F-APN-1607 in the US for its lead tau positron emission tomography (PET) tracer in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The study (NCT number: NCT04141150) will compare tau deposition patterns in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD and dementia due to AD with patterns in healthy older adults.
Besides detecting tau aggregates in AD, 18F-APN-1607 is unique among the tau PET tracers",Aprinoia_Initiation_of_a_Phase_2_Multicenter_Study_of_18F-APN-1607__a_Novel_Diagnostic_PET_Imaging_Tracer_for_the_Characterization_of_Tau_Burden_in_Alzheimer_s_Disease.html,html
"APRINOIA Therapeutics Reported a Novel Oligomer Tau Assay System with APNmAb005 Antibody, Successfully Detected the Target Molecule of Oligomer Tau Species and Elucidated the Increases Depending on Disease Progression of Alzheimer’s Disease | APRINOIA Therapeutics",,Aprinoia,"Tokyo, Japan – December 10, 2024 – APRINOIA Therapeutics has developed a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that employs its proprietary monoclonal antibody APNmAb005, which has high selectivity and sensitivity to its target molecule high-molecular-weight oligomeric tau (HMWoTau) species. The oligomer species robustly increased in the brain at Braak stage V and VI of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
APNmAb005-ELISA was demonstrated to be the first assay system, specifically detecting HMWoT",Aprinoia_APRINOIA_Therapeutics_Reported_a_Novel_Oligomer_Tau_Assay_System_with_APNmAb005_Antibody__Successfully_Detected_the_Target_Molecule_of_Oligomer_Tau_Species_and_Elucidated_the_Increases_Depending_on_Disease_Progression_of_Alzheimer_s_Disease.html,html
